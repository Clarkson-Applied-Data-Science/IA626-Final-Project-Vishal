# Road Accident Data Visualization Project

## Project Description

This project provides a web-based interface to visualize and analyze road accident data. The application is built using Flask and leverages interactive visualizations to help users explore accident trends, casualty data, and other relevant insights. The data is stored in a MySQL database and processed with Python libraries such as Pandas and Plotly for visualization.

This project is ideal for policymakers, traffic authorities, and researchers to make data-driven decisions for improving road safety and reducing accidents.

- **Details**:
  - Uses accident latitude and longitude for plotting.
  - Heat intensity represents accident severity (higher intensity = more severe).
- **Use Case**: Identify geographic hotspots of accidents to prioritize safety measures.
