**Road Accident Data Visualization Project**
Project Description
This project is a web application designed to visualize road accident data interactively. The dataset includes accident details, weather conditions, vehicle involvement, and casualty data to help analyze and understand traffic safety patterns. The application uses a MySQL database to store accident records and integrates data visualization tools to present the insights in a user-friendly manner.

The key objectives of the project are:

Visualizing accident severity and geographic distribution using heatmaps and charts.
Providing insights into casualty trends, weather impacts, and vehicle types involved in accidents.
Offering interactive dashboards to explore accident data dynamically.
